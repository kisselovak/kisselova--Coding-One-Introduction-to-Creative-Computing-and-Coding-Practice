x# WEEK 1 - KATIE KISELOVA

# Write a program that outputs “even” if a number is even and “odd
# if a number is odd. Think about what if the value is neither even nor odd (the value can be fractional or it can even not be a number at all).
# Hint: you may need to find out how to print a message to the terminal from Python and how to write + run a Python script file. 


num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
    print(" {0} is Even")
else:
    print("{0} is Odd")
    
# For code to work you have to run it each time to get answer even or odd, is not a continues loop.
